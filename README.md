<b># Project Title: Docure - Medical & Health Records Application</b>

Docure is an innovative mobile application designed to function as a comprehensive Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. It serves as a one-stop solution for managing healthcare needs for both patients and hospitals, providing a suite of features for appointment management, health tracking, and AI-driven insights.

<b>Project Overview</b>
The projectâ€™s primary objective is to create an immersive platform where hospitals can manage their EMR and appointments, while patients can book appointments, receive wellness advice, and get AI-generated insights on their medical data. This application aims to simplify the healthcare process by putting all solutions at the user's fingertips.
