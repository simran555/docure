# docure
Docure is an innovative Electronic Medical Record (EMR) app for hospitals and patients. Hospitals can manage EMRs and appointments, while patients can book visits, get wellness advice, and receive AI-driven insights. The prototype used JIRA, MIRO, Figma, and basic encryption for secure testing.
